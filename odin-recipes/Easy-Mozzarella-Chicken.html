    <h2>What is Easy Mozzarella Chicken</h2>
    <p>This easy mozzarella chicken is using a short cut by using frozen chicken
     tenders, that are air-fried and assembled in a casserole with jarred marinara
      and mozzarella cheese. Baked until bubbly, it's an easy family-friendly dish.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) package frozen chicken tenders</li>
            <li> (22 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese slices</li>
            <li>sliced fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole dish. </li>
        <li>Place frozen chicken pieces in the basket of the air fryer in a single layer. Air fry until golden, about 13 minutes. You may have to work in batches.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place mozzarella cheese slices between parchment paper and roll thin with a rolling pin; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour half of marinara sauce into the prepared casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Place the casserole dish in the preheated oven to warm the sauce, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven; nestle chicken tenders into the sauce. If desired, 
            spread remaining marinara sauce over tenders. Place cheese slices evenly over top of casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is golden and melted, about 15 minutes. Add cut basil strips to the top for garnish. Serve immediately.</li>
