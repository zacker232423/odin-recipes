    <h2>What Is a Reuben Sandwich?</h2>
    <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread.
     The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's 
     not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
     <h2>What Is On a Reuben?</h2>
     <p>A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, 
        and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
        <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing.</li>
        <li>On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices
             corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss
              cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down.
               Butter the top of each sandwich</li>
        <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle;
            butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill 
            until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
