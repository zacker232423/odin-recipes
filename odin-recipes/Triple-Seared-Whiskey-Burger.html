    <h2>What Is a Triple Seared Whiskey Burger</h2>
    <p>This triple-seared whiskey burger uses the technique from my Japanese-style 
    triple seared steak, and produces the most extraordinarily delicious, juicy burger,
     with a whiskey-soy glazed exterior.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>1 pound ground beef (85% lean recommended)</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons avocado oil</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
         <li>1/3 cup whiskey</li>
         <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Wet your hands, and form 2 (8-ounce) burgers; place on a plate, cover, and refrigerate until ready to grill. For this process, cold meat works best.</li>
         <li>Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. The coals should 
            be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat hits the grill.</li>
         <li>Rub burgers all over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area is completely covered.</li>
         <li>Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside.</li>
         <li>Place burgers on hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, 2 minutes per side.</li>
         <li>Transfer burgers into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute. Most of the salt will rinse off.</li>
         <li>Place burgers back onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides again, 2 minutes per side. You can baste steak with a small amount of whiskey while searing.</li>
         <li>Add soy sauce to another shallow bowl. Add burgers to the bowl, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute.</li>
         <li>Return burgers to the hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill each side until desired doneness is reached, about 2 minutes. For a
             rosy-pink (medium-rare) inside, remove when an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 125 to 130 F (52 to 54 degrees C).</li>
